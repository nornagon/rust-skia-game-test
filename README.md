# Rust + Skia

This is an example of using [rust-skia](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia)
together with [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) to render
hardware-accelerated 2D vector content into a native OS window.

[Skia](https://skia.org/) is a powerful 2D graphics library by Google. It
powers the `<canvas>` element in Chromium, as well as Android's UI. It's also
great for writing games with!
